## Question: What could the key operating standards of a digital trust ecosystem?

This question goes to the very mission of the ToIP Foundation, which is to standardize digital trust infrastructure using a dual stack of governance and technology. So our answer is that the “operating standards” for the Ontario digital trust ecosystem should be based on the ToIP stack.

Specifically, the governance authority for each digital trust ecosystem SHOULD develop and publish a  **Digital Trust Ecosystem Governance Framework** specifying:

1. the purpose, principles, and policies for the ecosystem. This ecosystem governance framework should follow the ToIP governance metamodel. Its Controlled Documents should include a base level of risk assessment, a trust assurance framework, and a certification program.
2. the technical solcution prefernces by using a ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP) that includes the relevant standards and interoperability profiles at all four layers of the ToIP stack. The technical components of the certification program should operate against this TIP.
