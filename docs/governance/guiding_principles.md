## Question: What should be some core guiding principles for a  governance framework?

Each digital trust ecosystem will establish a governance authority that can define the principles required by the ecosystem governance framework. Several ecosystem projects have formed Task Forces under the ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group to collaborate on similar work. Here are examples of the types of principles that these Task Forces have been evaluating:

* [The Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf) (Kim Cameron)
