## Question: How should the responsibilities for different parts of a digital trust ecosystem be delineated with respect to the roles of the public and private sectors?

The ToIP Governance Stack relies on an authoritative body, a Governance Authority, to oversee the ecosystem and establish requirements to all stakeholders.  The efficacy of that authority is dependent on each ecosystem.  Some may be best driven by public entities alone, some by private interest. Generally, citizens and companies do not want government oversight into their data or even the perception that the government may be viewing their data.
We recommend that a governance authority be composed of a consortium of public sector and private interests composing a variety of stakeholder positions that can be considered to maximize public acceptance.  We suggest government endorsement to the consortium and reinforcement to the principles and standards in operation; then letting qualified commercial service providers run the systems.

Each digital trust ecosystem will need to work through some common governance issues, namely -- Who will provide expertise and models for ecosystem intellectual property to address:

1. Data IP (relating to contribution of data and information from a variety of sources and from which a variety of insights and applications can be developed)
2. Inventive IP (relating to the tolls, software and inventions, patentable or not, that may arise from projects undertaken as part of a verifiable credential ecosystem and which may make use of Data IP)
3. Processes to support collaboration with ecosystem participants/partners, experts in the field and other regulatory entities.
