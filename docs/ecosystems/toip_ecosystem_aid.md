## Question: What role can ToIP play in the development and maintenance of a digital trust Ecosystems?

ToIP is set up, with formal Working Groups and focused ad-hoc Task Forces addressing key questions and requirements as they arise, to be nimble and responsive.

Work underway at the Foundation includes technical interoperability testing of components that go into a complete version of the stack, defining key concepts in common glossaries that can be used across Working Groups, establishing Governance models that can be used to define requirements across varied use cases, and designing the human experience of establishing digital trust - among many other activities.

The best way for us to help is to establish an open dialogue that integrates the challenges you face into the on-going work of our community.

We suggest joining the Trust Over IP Foundation.
