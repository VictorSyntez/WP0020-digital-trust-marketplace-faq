## Question: How should a digital trust ecosystem be funded?

The funding of a digital trust ecosystem project needs to consider:

* Who should be responsible for capital and operating costs?
* What creative finance schemas can be deployed that optimize the strengths of both public and private sector participants?
* What aspects, if any, of an ecosystem funding model that SHOULD be owned and managed by a government entity, in the public interest/good?

Funding for an underlying network/ledger should be shared amongst the key stakeholders in an ecosystem. While the government plays a crucial role in this ecosystem as an Authoritative Issuer it does not need to lead the operations of such a network. It can act as an equal partner of the other stakeholders. If there is a leadership role where the government is uniquely positioned it would be at the governance level where government can set the rules and regulations as it does in many industries.
