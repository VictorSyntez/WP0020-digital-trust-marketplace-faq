## Question: What are the opportunities for monetization exist for ecosystem participants?

The support for the Issuer, Holder, and Verifier model allows for multiple areas where monetization can be enabled. The [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF)](https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/) adds a potential fourth party - a Witness - where there is a requirement for interaction or observation. Payment could go to one or more of the parties in the credential exchange triad. However, early monetization efforts may focus on direct cost savings to participants.

There are several discrete points that can be considered related to monetization:

* Starting with monetization approaches (e.g. Holder pays extra for a digital identity card) may inhibit adoption and innovation. Proving the value (cost savings or new revenue) before fees are charged will be crucial.

  * Compliance - on major job sites compliance checks (e.g. confirming all personnel are fully trained and certified for particular tasks; permitting) drive costs up. Many compliance checks could be fully automated. The Government of British Columbia has examined opportunities for this kind of automation.
